🖊️ Handwritten Digit Classification using Deep Learning 🖊️
🚀 Overview
This project involves developing and deploying a deep learning model using Python, TensorFlow, and NumPy for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is trained on grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) and achieves high accuracy in recognizing them.

The model can be used in various applications, including:
✔️ Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
✔️ Automated Form Processing
✔️ Digital Handwriting Analysis
